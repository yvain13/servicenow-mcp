# ServiceNow MCP Server

A Model Completion Protocol (MCP) server implementation for ServiceNow, allowing Claude to interact with ServiceNow instances.

## Overview

This project implements an MCP server that enables Claude to connect to ServiceNow instances, retrieve data, and perform actions through the ServiceNow API. It serves as a bridge between Claude and ServiceNow, allowing for seamless integration.

## Features

- Connect to ServiceNow instances using various authentication methods (Basic, OAuth, API Key)
- Query ServiceNow records and tables
- Create, update, and delete ServiceNow records
- Execute ServiceNow scripts and workflows
- Access and query the ServiceNow Service Catalog
- Analyze and optimize the ServiceNow Service Catalog
- Debug mode for troubleshooting

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- A ServiceNow instance with appropriate access credentials

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/servicenow-mcp.git
   cd servicenow-mcp
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install the package:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

### Integration with Claude Desktop

To configure the ServiceNow MCP server in Claude Desktop:

1. Edit the Claude Desktop configuration file at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or the appropriate path for your OS:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ServiceNow": {
      "command": "/Users/yourusername/dev/servicenow-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "servicenow_mcp.cli"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL": "https://your-instance.service-now.com",
        "SERVICENOW_USERNAME": "your-username",

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Errors with Change Management Tools

1. **Error: `argument after ** must be a mapping, not CreateChangeRequestParams`**
   - This error occurs when you pass a `CreateChangeRequestParams` object instead of a dictionary to the `create_change_request` function.
   - Solution: Make sure you're passing a dictionary with the parameters, not a Pydantic model object.
   - Note: The change management tools have been updated to handle this error automatically. The functions will now attempt to unwrap parameters if they're incorrectly wrapped or passed as a Pydantic model object.

2. **Error: `Missing required parameter 'type'`**
   - This error occurs when you don't provide all required parameters for creating a change request.
   - Solution: Make sure to include all required parameters. For `create_change_request`, both `short_description` and `type` are required.

3. **Error: `Invalid value for parameter 'type'`**
   - This error occurs when you provide an invalid value for the `type` parameter.
   - Solution: Use one of the valid values: "normal", "standard", or "emergency".

4. **Error: `Cannot find get_headers method in either auth_manager or server_config`**
   - This error occurs when the parameters are passed in the wrong order or when using objects that don't have the required methods.
   - Solution: Make sure you're passing the `auth_manager` and `server_config` parameters in the correct order. The functions have been updated to handle parameter swapping automatically.
